Iris Flower Classification:

The project is a part of the Let's Grow More Data Science Internship program. It involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Dataset: The dataset used in this project is the Iris Flower dataset, which is a popular dataset in the machine learning community. It consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three iris species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). For each sample, we have measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
